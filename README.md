#Objective

Develop a turn-based 5x5 board game where two players compete using 5 pieces each: 3 pawns (P1, P2, P3), 1 Hero1 (H1), and 1 Hero2 (H2). This project was developed as part of the HitWicket Software Engineer assignment.
Game Rules 📜

1. Piece Movement:
    * Pawn (P1, P2, P3): Moves one block in any direction (L, R, F, B).
    * Hero1 (H1): Moves exactly two blocks in any straight direction (L, R, F, B) and captures opponent pieces.
    * Hero2 (H2): Moves exactly two blocks diagonally (FL, FR, BL, BR) and captures opponent pieces.
2. Player Interaction:
    * Players will take turns selecting a piece and move it using the following commands:
        * F (Forward)
        * L (Left)
        * B (Backward)
        * R (Right)
        * FL (Forward-Left)
        * FR (Forward-Right)
        * BL (Backward-Left)
        * BR (Backward-Right)
    * Each move will be executed, and the board will be updated accordingly.
3. Turn Exchange:
    * Players will alternate turns, with one turn per player.
4. Board Updates and Captures:
    * The board will be updated after each valid move.
    * Captures will be handled if an opponent's piece is in the path of a Hero piece's movement.
5. Move History:
    * A move history will be maintained and displayed during the game. (e.g., "Player A moved P1 Forward").
